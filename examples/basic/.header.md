# Basic

Configuration in this directory creates the Prefect agent deployed on a single EC2 instance in an autoscaling group. It also creates a lightweight network to host the agent.

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:
```
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```
Note that this example may create resources which can cost money (AWS EC2, VPC endpoints, NAT gateway, for example). Run terraform destroy when you don't need these resources.
